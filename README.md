# TODO

## [TodoCQRS](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/todo-cqrs)

The project is almost done. Lets finish up the final bit of implementation, clean up the documentation and fix the flaky test suite.

## [axis-discovery-go](https://github.com/FantasticFiasco/axis-discovery-go)

The project has just started and there is a lot more to do. Other than the current aim to support SSDP we should also aim to support Bonjour.
